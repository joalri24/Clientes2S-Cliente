# Costumers-Client
Windows Forms application used as a prototype for a Costumer Management System for a consulting enterprise. 
This is an early version of the client app where the employees can register their customers and keep records of their contact information and pending tasks.
The project was approved an implemented, but the final product code is property of the enterprise and it isnâ€™t public.
